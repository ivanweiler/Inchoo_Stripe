Stripe payment gateway Magento extension
========================================

Stripe payment gateway handles everything, including storing cards, subscriptions, and direct payouts to your bank account. This extension adds support for Stripe (https://stripe.com) payment gateway in Magento. 

**Important: This module isn't actively developed nor maintened anymore. There are many other Stripe extensions available at Magento Connect, most of them use recommended PCI compliant stripe.js approach, so use one of those for production sites.**
